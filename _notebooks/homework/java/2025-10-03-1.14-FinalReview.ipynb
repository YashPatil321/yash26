    "## 1. Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Year\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beginning of Year:**\n",
    "I had no knowledge of Java. I didn't understand classes, methods, or basic syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now:**\n",
    "I've come a long way and have a solid grasp of most CSA concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 1 - Primitives:** Got it down. Can work with int, double, boolean, and do basic operations without issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 2 - Using Objects:** Comfortable with creating objects, calling methods, and using String operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 3 - Boolean Expressions:** Understanding if-else statements and logical operators is straightforward now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 4 - Iteration:** Loops (for, while) make sense. Can write them and trace through them pretty easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 5 - Writing Classes:** This is the one I'm still working on. Constructor overloading and understanding when to use static vs instance methods trips me up sometimes. Getting better though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 6 - Arrays:** Solid with arrays, can traverse and manipulate them without problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit 7 - ArrayList:** Actually prefer ArrayList over arrays. The methods and flexibility make more sense to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I went from zero to being able to build functional programs. Just need more practice with class design and constructors."

    "## 2. Key Learnings from Three Sprints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging Sprint:**\n",
    "This sprint was crucial. Learned how to actually trace through code, use print statements effectively, and identify where things break. Debugging isn't just fixing errors, it's understanding why they happen. This skill saved me countless hours on later projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Dynamics:**\n",
    "Always worked with a full boys group before, so working with a girl trio this time was a new experience. It brought a lot of perspective and different approaches to problem-solving. The communication style was different and honestly more organized. Made me realize how important diverse perspectives are in tech.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sprint Planning with Whiteboards:**\n",
    "Game changer. Last year we didn't plan as well and just kind of jumped into coding. This year, fully fleshing out our plans on whiteboards before starting helped us be super efficient. We could visualize the entire project structure, divide tasks clearly, and spot potential issues before they became problems. The result was finishing sprints with both speed and quality. The whiteboard sessions made sure everyone understood their role and how all the pieces fit together."

    "## 3. Night at the Museum Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "Night at the Museum provided valuable experience presenting our work to parents and community members. Overall, the feedback was positive and the event helped me understand the importance of communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Night at the Museum]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8a8859eb-7f3d-4d5f-8e7b-cefdeecdd495.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Went Well:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents were impressed with how we applied CSA knowledge to real-life scenarios. They were surprised by our understanding of LinkedIn profiles, resumes, and professional development. They commented that our lessons were well-structured and that we explained complex concepts clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "My LinkedIn auto-generate feature stood out because it showed how programming can automate professional tasks, which parents hadn't expected from a CSA class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The current format had everyone explaining all sections in one go, which caused some issues:\n",
    "- People got bored listening to long explanations of every feature\n",
    "- Limited interaction with different team members\n",
    "- Some visitors felt overwhelmed by too much information at once\n",
    "- Difficult to manage crowd flow and attention spans\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions for Next Time:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Organize the presentation around **stations** where:\n",
    "- Each station focuses on one specific feature or concept\n",
    "- Visitors rotate through stations at their own pace\n",
    "- People can engage step-by-step rather than all at once\n",
    "- More opportunities to interact with different team members\n",
    "- Easier to maintain engagement with shorter, focused explanations\n",
    "- Visitors can spend more time on topics that interest them most\n",
    "\n",
    "This station-based approach would make the event more interactive, prevent information overload, and create a better experience for both presenters and visitors."
